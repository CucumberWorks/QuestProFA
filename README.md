# Introduction
This is a modular accesory system that aims to solve ergonomics issues of the Quest Pro.

Most of the components can be printed on a home FDM 3D printer. The rest of the hardware are common M3 screws and nuts.

# Things you will need
**Stage 1 Modification: Top Strap**
| Parts      | Number |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| TopStrapL.stl   | 1       |
| TopStrapR.stl   | 1       |
| Velcro Strap   | 1       |

A 3cm x 50cm velcro strap is recommended. But you can change the strap length based on your needs.

***
**Stage 1.5 Modification: 1/4 AUX Hardpoints**
| Parts      | Number |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| TrackerL.stl   | 1       |
| TrackerR.stl   | 1       |
| Brace.stl   | 1       |
| M3x10 screw   | 6       |
| M3 nut(nylock reccomended)   | 6       |
| 1/4 screw(10mm thread length)   | 1 or 2       |
| Super Glue   | For securing nuts       |

A 3cm x 50cm velcro strap is recommended. But you can change the strap length based on your needs.
This modification adds hardpoints for mounting additional accesories such as VIVE tracker and Tundra trackers.
You may need to get 1/4 tripod mounting screws in different sizes to find the ones you need.

***
**Stage 2 Modification: Additional Top Strap and BoboVR Battery Mount**
| Parts      | Number |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| BoboBracket.stl   | 1       |
| 3M VHB Tape   | Cut       |
| Velcro Strap   | 1       |

This addes an additional velcro strap that forms a T shape to further distribute the weight on your head. You can replace the strap with after market padded top straps for the Quest 2 or the Pico 4 for extra comfort.
This also extends the battery life of the Quest Pro with the BoboVR B2 battery dock. You need to stick the battery dock to the BoboBracket.stl with VHB tape and plug the charging cable to the USB C Port.

***
**Stage 3 Modification: Additional Cooling**
| Parts      | Number |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| NF-A4x20(or A4x10)   | 1-3      |
| FanCover.stl   | 1-3      |
| FanBase.stl   | 1      |
| FanSwivelBracket.stl   | 1-3      |
| FanSwivelArm.stl   | Optional      |
| FanSwivelArmOffset.stl   | Optional      |
| M3x25 screw   | Many       |
| M3 nylock   | Many       |
| M3x30/M3x20   | Many       |
| USB-C PWM Fan Controller   | 1       |
| USB-C Splitter   | 1       |
| 3M VHB Tape   | Cut       |
| Super Glue   | For securing nuts       |


This is totally unnecessary and very experimental. Running the fans at full speed drains the Quest Pro's internal battery, and it is recommended to have the BoboVR battery always connected. This will add addtional weight to the system.
A USB-C splitter for Android phone is need to split the single USB port on the Quest Pro for charging and power delivery to the fans. The fans are controlled through a fan controller. You will need to either source or build the controller yourself.

# Tips for 3D Printed

Most of the parts are designed in a way that optimizes part strength and support usage. The main parts including TopStrapL.stl, TopStrapR.stl, TrackerL.stl and Brace.stl are designed so that they do not require any support.

You can refer to the image below for recommended part orientation.

PLA is sufficient and infill density >40% is reccomended.
